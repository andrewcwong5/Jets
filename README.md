// Overview

This project creates an Airfield object that stores different types of Jet objects within an Airfield Object. Once the jets/planes are in the Airfield we can add/delete planes and make them do things through methods.

// Technologies/Topics Applied
We start things off with Encapsulation to establish all the parent class and the subclasses of the Jets we'll be using. Objects will follow the concept of Abstraction. Jet is an abstract class because it has sub classes. All jets have the same fields and share the fly method, but different types of jets will have unique method like FighterJets can fight and Cargo planes can load cargo.

// Lessons Learned

only put 2 things in the static main: a run method and a "new" declaration statement
